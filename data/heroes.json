Unfortunately, with an average 3B STR, Dragon Slayer isn't much good without loot and treasure bonuses. Dragon Blade only manages to squeeze into the Tank roll because of his better Arm and AoE for his Bottled Dragon Breath (Dangerous, Melee, Sweep 2, Fire, Potion 1) which is nice for dealing with small crowds of enemies that have multiple hearts (Deal one damage now, and they'll burn up later).",

        "iamfanboy_Strategy_Description": "Probably the most important piece of information on Scarecrow's card is Flammable, which sets him on Fire if an action is made with him as the target, regardless of the results of the action. This, however, is helped by Fixable, which makes the Bandage basic action heal two wounds whenever it succeeds with him as the target, and more importantly, Bumper Crop (Augment, Wave 1, Heal 2, AP 2) which he can use to heal himself and his pals, provided they can all stand next to each other and hold hands. Harvest Scythe (Melee, Sweep 3, Slow, AP 2) is a good offensive action, as it covers nine squares in front of the Scarecrow. It's only downside is that Slow isn't a very strong status effect. Finally, he has his Pumpkin Bomb (Dangerous, Range 6, Burst 1, WILL vs DEX, Fire, Potion 1) which can be used to quickly set a small group of monsters on fire. Additionally, since Flammable only effects actions which target Scarecrow, it won't set him on fire if he's in the burst. Instead, he'll be set on fire by his 1B DEX, which is not nearly enough to match his 2R WILL.",
